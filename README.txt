BharatX Pay In 3 plugin is a payment gateway plugin which allows you to accept payments in 3 easy instalments.

== Description ==  

BharatX Pay in 3 is a white-labeled Pay in 3 parts plugin 
which allows your customers to split their payments into
3 parts, one tap, with any documentation. 
The user gets access to “Buy now pay later”, and has to
pay 1/3rd of the amount at the time of placing the order 
and the rest after 30 days and 60 days, with no extra charge.
The payment gateway would be a standalone feature at the checkout
page and can be customised as per your needs. 
For example, it can also be called “YourBrandName Pay in 3", 
helping you to build/strengthen your brand name further, 
and building customers trust and engagement with your website. 
After the customer chooses Pay in 3 on the checkout page, 
the customer goes through a one minute sign-in process via 
a popup and after the payment is completed, is redirected 
to the payment confirmation page, making it a seamless 
process with low drop-off due to the ease of the flow.
